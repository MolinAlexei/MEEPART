# MEEP_optics

The goal of this code repository is to provide useful functions for simulating refractor telescopes using the publicly available Meep code library (see link below): https://github.com/NanoComp/meep

For an introduction to MEEP in the context of refractor telescopes, look at MEEP_usage_notebook. 

For a demo of the different functions available in the current state of the code, look at Code_demo

For a first example of a far field beam of a focused optical system as an analysis of the system, look at Optical_system_analysis.
