# MEEP Optics

The goal of this code repository is to provide useful functions for simulating refractor telescopes using the publicly available Meep code library (see link below): https://github.com/NanoComp/meep
MEEP is a Finite Difference Time Domain simulation tool that allows for accurate simulation of Maxwell's equations in any media, i.e. electromagnetic wavec propagation. Using this and tools built in this code to create standard objects in the context of refractor telescopes, the following code allows to propagate EM waves in such a system. The goal is also to provide analysis tools to understand any changes in the system.

For an introduction to MEEP in the context of refractor telescopes, look at MEEP_usage_notebook. 

For a demo of the different functions available in the current state of the code, look at Code_demo

For a first example of a far field beam of a focused optical system as an analysis of the system, look at Optical_system_analysis.
